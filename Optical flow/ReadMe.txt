Just launch the matlab code and you will get 4 figures. two with flow overlayed on the two frames, on overlay with the time derivative and one with quiver of the flow in a seperate plot.

You can change the frames used in the first block of the code and also try the program with different parameters.

For the rest the code is well commented so you shouldn't be lost in it.
